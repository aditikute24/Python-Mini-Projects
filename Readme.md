# Python Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of small Python projects that I've created to explore various libraries and concepts in Python programming. Each project is designed to be simple yet insightful, providing hands-on experience with Python.

## Projects Included

### 1. `copypaste.py`
A script that simplifies copying and pasting operations. This can be particularly useful for automating tasks that require frequent clipboard management.

### 2. `dict.py`
A simple Python script for working with dictionaries. It includes various operations such as adding, updating, and deleting key-value pairs.

### 3. `my_googlesearch.py`
A script that uses Google search to retrieve and display results directly from the command line.

### 4. `qr.py`
This script generates QR codes from given text or URLs. It outputs a `.png` image file containing the QR code.

### 5. `urlextract.py` and `urlextract2.py`
These scripts extract URLs from a given block of text or file. `urlextract2.py` might be a modified or enhanced version of `urlextract.py`.

### 6. `urlshortner.py`
A URL shortening script that takes a long URL and converts it into a shortened version using an external service or custom logic.

### 7. `wikisearch.py`
A script that performs searches on Wikipedia and retrieves summaries of the results, directly from the command line.

## Additional Files

- `qrcode.png`: An example output file generated by the `qr.py` script.
